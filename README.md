# global-functions
Some bash functions and aliases to use with local Docker development

## How to use
You can put this in your .bashrc, .bash_profile or .zshrc:
```bash
if [ -f ~/PATH/TO/LOCAL/REPO/.global-functions ]; then
  . ~/PATH/TO/LOCAL/REPO/.global-functions
fi
```
Make sure you change the path (`/PATH/TO/LOCAL/REPO` in this example)
to your repository location path.
